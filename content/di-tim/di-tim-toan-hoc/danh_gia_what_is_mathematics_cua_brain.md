Thirty-two years ago while browsing in my high school library, I happened upon an intriguingly titled expository book. I knew astonishingly little of the practice of mathematics at the time. I was
aware that geometry derived from Thales, Pythagoras, and Euclid. Whether or not any geometric theorems were discovered after Euclid I could not say. That algebra and trigonometry were the results of conscious development would no more have occurred to me than the idea that the English language was the creation of dedicated professional linguists. I knew the names and work of many scientists-Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo in astronomy; Darwin, Mendel, and Pasteur in biology; Boyle, Lavoisier, and Curie in chemistry; Archimedes, Newton, and Einstein in physics; Jenner, Harvey, and Koch in medicine; and many others, none of whom were mathematicians. Although my recreational reading of Hall and Knight had exposed me to an odd assortment of surnames, such as Venn and Horner, I knew of no first-rate scientist in the field of mathematics. Indeed, I did not really know that there was such a field.

The book I pulled off the shelf that day did more than open my eyes; it changed my life. I graduated from high school later that year, armed with a twenty-dollar book certificate. It might have been prudent to save my award for the college textbooks that I would soon re-quire. However, with no further access to my school library, I had a more pressing need. For less than nine dollars What Is Mathematics? by Richard Courant andHerbert Robbins became the first volume in my collection of mathematics books.

Only a sketchy summary of this well-known text need be given here. The first chapter is largely devoted to number theory. A chapter on real and complex numbers follows. The discussion includes Dedekind cuts, Cantor’s theory of cardinal numbers, and Liouville’s construction of transcendental numbers. The third chapter is concerned with field extensions and geometric constructions. It includes a thorough investigation of the impossible straightedge-and-compass constructions of classical Greek geometry (stopping short of a proof of Lindemann’s Theorem). Chapters on projective geometry and topology come next. In preparation for the remainder of the book, Courant and Robbins continue with a chapter that introduces the reader to the rigorous definition of limit, reinforced by genuine proofs of the Intermediate and Extreme Value Theorems. Optimization and calculus constitute the final two chapters in a rather unusual ordering: the calculus of variations is introduced before the calculus, the definite integral before the derivative.

As is often the case with skilled exposition of deep subject matter, What Is Mathematics? can be read at different levels. The professional mathematician who has not yet encountered the book is likely to find new things in the chapters on projective geometry and optimization. Also rewarding are the numerous small details that illuminate material that is more old hat. For example, an excellent “proof” that all positive integers are equal warns the reader against improper use of mathematical induction. Later on, a quite different “proof” of the same absurdity illustrates the need for establishing the existence of an extremum before it is determined.

Of course, What Is Mathematics? was not written for the professional mathematician. Many of the topics that are covered in the first six chapters bring to mind the “transition” books that have sprouted up in the last decade. They are often intended for sophomore or junior mathematics majors and have titles such as Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning. In fact, Courant and Robbins foresaw that their book could serve as the text for “college courses of an unconventional type on the fundamental concepts of mathematics.” In conceiving What Is Mathematics?, Courant hoped for a wide readership that would comprise a broad spectrum of educated laypersons. Accordingly, What Is Mathematics? “presupposes only knowledge that a good high school course could impart.” In those days-the first edition appeared in 1941, followed by three revisions at two-year intervals-calculus was rarely if ever part of the high school curriculum.

In the sixty years during which Courant and Robbins, as the book is often called, has been in print, several distinguished scholars have had the opportunity to sing its praises. Reviewing the first edition, E. T. Bell described the work as “inspirational collateral reading.” Hermann Weyl thought it “a work of high perfection.” For Marston Morse it was simply “a work of art.” Even Albert Einstein chimed in with high praise. Any subsequent reviewer with the slightest humility would be excused for feeling that his further say-so would only be superfluous. To counter the perception of immodesty, I should point out that I brought something to my first reading of Courant and Robbins that none of these learned scientists could boast: profound ignorance. Whereas Einstein found the text “easily understandable,” I often struggled.

Though the prerequisites for What Is Mathematics? are minimal, the “certain degree of intellectual maturity” that is mentioned vaguely in
the preface is likely to be a steep hurdle for the hypothetical layperson Courant hoped to capture as his reader. Twenty-nine pages into the book the Prime Number Theorem is stated. It is not proved, of course, but the statement alone is a tough swallow for the reader who has not yet seen the natural logarithm. (At this point Courant and
Robbins introduce the logarithm as area under a curve, a concept that is not made precise until the last chapter.) The reader who persists soon comes to the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, a theorem that is exceptionally beautiful to those who have an ample supply of that maturity thing, but is thoroughly bewildering to those who do not.

Did Courant and Robbins miscalculate? Not at all! As the preface says, a genuine comprehension of mathematics cannot be acquired through “pain-
less entertainment.” There are plenty of popular books that run away from every mathematical difficulty; the reader who seeks such a treatment has always been well served. Courant and Robbins has earned what ought to be a permanent place in the mathematical literature by conveying not only a treasure-trove of mathematical facts but also the ideas and methods behind them. To my mind the balance of intuition and rigor is just right for a popular book that intends to lay open the real substance of mathematics. In the matter of proofs I cannot think of a single misjudgment. Every proof that is included, no matter how difficult for the beginner, is there because it contains an idea that any one who perseveres can master. There is no better way to begin the acquisition of intellectual maturity.

If the world was the way we wished, then What Is Mathematics? would have sold like nickel beer. Courant had ambitious expectations for a work he
said “expresses my own personal views and aimsmore than any other of my publications.” Although he considered the title “a little bit dishonest,” he heeded Thomas Mann, who had experienced the effect a tantalizing title can have on marketability. The title notwithstanding, sales of What Is Mathematics? did not reach Courant’s hopes. If Constance Reid’s ballpark estimate of over 100,000 copies up until 1976 is at all accurate, then annual purchases by individuals could never have amounted to more than a trickle. (Oxford University Press did not respond to my request for a more recent figure.)

A disappointment to its senior author, What Is Mathematics? turned into a bitter blow for Herbert Robbins. In 1938 at the age of twenty-three, Robbins completed his dissertation in topology under the direction of Hassler Whitney. He came to New York University as an instructor one year later. Although he “had not the faintest acquaintance with or interest in either probability or statistics,” he was assigned such a course when William Feller did not arrive there as planned. It marked the start of Robbins’s long, distinguished career in mathematical statistics. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he taught at the University of North Carolina and then, from 1953 until his retirement in 1985, at Columbia University. After his first retirement Robbins taught at Rutgers University, Newark, until he retired again in 1997. Shortly before that second retirement Robbins’s name was featured in news reports in conjunction with a remarkable software development. As a Harvard undergraduate in 1933 Robbins had conjectured that certain algebras, which came to be called Robbins algebras, are Boolean. Headlines were made in 1996 when the Robbins problem, which had thwarted all human effort, was proved automatically by a theorem-proving program developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Herbert Robbins died earlier this year at the age of eighty-six. (For further biographical details and a discussion of the contributions Robbins made to mathematical statistics, the interested reader may consult [8]. Transcriptions of two interviews, [1], [6], make for fascinating reading.)

Robbins was an excellent writer. His prose was sometimes provocative, often witty, always stylish. Serendipity brought him to New York University at the moment Courant was in need of help improving and amplifying the mimeographed notes that would become What Is Mathematics?. By Robbins’s estimate the manuscript was only one quarter to one third written when he became involved. In an interview with Constance Reid he characterized his collaboration with Courant as “pretty close.”

Mathematical collaboration is such a wonderful process that conventions have evolved to protect its sanctity. The basic principles are to not ask who did what and to assign each coauthor three quarters of the total credit due. In the case of What Is Mathematics? the temptation to violate the rules proved too great. The disparity in status between the two coauthors at the time of publication, the book’s dedication (to the children of Courant), the preface (written and signed by Courant alone), the copyright (in Courant’s name only) all prompted indiscreet questions. With justification Robbins became sick of the inquiries (for which he had a sharply humorous retort [10]). The relationship he had with Courant ended sordidly, with recriminations passing between the coauthors.

It is ironic really. One of the ten lessons Gian-Carlo Rota wished he had been taught is that mathematicians are more likely to be remembered for their expository work than for their original research [11]. Courant and Robbins may become the most convincing examples of this lesson. Their names have been inextricably linked for sixty years, and the bond will only grow stronger. I am reminded of Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert penned many well-received plays, which are now
known only to specialists of the Victorian theater.

Even a classic can benefit from a sprucing up now and then, especially if it seeks to portray the existing state of an active field. Courant and Robbins was long overdue for an update when Oxford University Press brought out a second edition in 1996. This version is said to be by Courant and Rob bins and revised by Ian Stewart. The latter part of that description is deceptive. Crack open the new edition: if you are familiar with the original, then you will be treated to a wave of nostalgia. All the old figures are there. Even the original typesetting has been preserved-quite a welcome change from the homogenized TEX of the present. Closer inspection, however, reveals something less welcome: the new edition is by and large a photographic reproduction. I could not find even one change in it. Stewart rationalizes this in his preface: “not a single word or symbol had to be deleted from this new edition.” Really? After half a century could we not have had a correction to the name of Mr. Arch medes (p. 400)? Does anyone still use the term “dyadic system” in preference to “binary system” (pp. 8-9)? I suppose that there is nothing wrong with retaining the notation $C_i^n$ for the binomial coefficients, but it does seem dated now that mathematical notation has standardized on something else.Sullivan composed many popular vocal and orchestral works: they are rarely heard nowadays. Yet working as a team, Gilbert and Sullivan were nonpareil. Their partnership was broken by a quarrel, but the work it produced is eternal. So too may the individual achievements of Courant and Robbins fade with the passing of time. So too does their joint effort seem destined to sparkle forever.

How, then, does the second edition differ from its predecessor? Stewart has added a thirty-seven-page new last chapter titled “Recent Developments”. Without doubt, the mathematician will value Stewart’s contribution. As a reviewer I cannot be so positive. My most serious complaints stem from the decision to leave the original text unaltered, reserving the necessary amendments for the new chapter. The modern reader still finds the statuses of Fermat’s Last Theorem, the Four Color Problem, and the Continuum Hypothesis reported as they existed in 1947. There are no footnotes nor any forward references to Stewart’s new chapter that alert the reader to the falsity of the statements he has read. This is particularly regrettable in a work that is not aimed at experts.

Given Stewart’s lengthy record of successful popular exposition, I am surprised to find myself at odds with several aspects of his approach. I do not believe he focuses sharply enough on the hypothetical educated layperson that Courant and Robbins had in mind as their targeted reader. Summarizing over two thousand years of mathematical developments, Courant and Robbins deftly picked out the highlights and kept the discussion within the attention spans of their intended readers. By contrast, Stewart has been much less selective in telling us about the progress that has been made in less than sixty years. I fear the beginner will find the detail overwhelming in several places. That danger is especially great in the new discussions that receive inadequate foundation. For example, Courant and Robbins limit their treatment of the zeta function $\zeta (s)$ to (real) $s\geq 1$ (pp. 480-481). A few pages earlier they hint at analytic continuation when they formally substitute $z=ix$ into the power series for $exp(z)$, (real $z$). I do not think the average reader will, on this basis, see so far as to extend the domain of the zeta function to complex $s$ . Courant and Robbins must have come to the same conclusion, for they forbear mentioning the Riemann Hypothesis. Yet, without further preparation, Stewart rattles off its statement and, not stopping there, tells us what we will know should the (unstated) Generalized Riemann Hypothesis ever be proved true. Surely this is too much!

Although Stewart asserts in his preface that he has “made no attempt to introduce new topics that have recently come to prominence,” he admits to bending his rules on occasion. Thus, the treatment of dimension by Courant and Robbins, fitting for its place in the chapter on topology, is used by Stewart as a pretext for a digression on Hausdorff dimension. Why? The original authors certainly knew about the concept and chose not to include it. This is a matter of the camel’s nose slipping under the tent: once Hausdorff dimension enters, fractals inevitably follow. Granted, fractals can be amusing and even the source of serious mathematics. However, when given a gratuitous, superficial treatment, are they Courant-Robbins worthy?

There are some other places where old friends of What Is Mathematics? may wish that Stewart had used his author’s license less freely. In the matter of Whitney’s problem of an inverted pendulum on a train, a neat little riddle that attracted the attention of Littlewood [9, pp. 32-35], Stewart relates a challenge to the basic continuity assumption that underlies the solution given by Courant and Robbins. Ironically, that challenge itself relies on the assumption that the train can move in a way that is physically impossible, as Gillman has pointed out in his review [5]. (As long as I am mentioning the work of other reviewers, I would be remiss if I did not steer you to [3].)

It would be pointless and misleading to continue with further quibbles. It is hardly shocking to see that even an accomplished author can fall short of the standard Courant and Robbins set. On balance there can be no question that Stewart’s contribution enhances What Is Mathematics?. Given that the original text is included verbatim in the new edition, Stewart’s chapter may be regarded as a welcome bonus. At the time of this writing, you can still buy What Is Mathematics? for less than twenty dollars (although it is no longer clothbound, and you don’t get as much change back); that makes it a real bargain.

Turning the yellowed pages of my first edition, seeing annotations in my own hand that I no longer remember making, considering the longevity of this classic, I am prompted to reflect on many things. The high school in which I discovered What Is Mathematics? was boarded up many years ago. The bookstore where I bought it has long since given way to the caffè latte trade. Now its two authors are dead. Tempus fugit. We mathematicians like to think that our subject has a permanent character that is rarely found elsewhere. As Hardy put it, “Greek mathematics is permanent, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not.” Hardy penned that thought as Courant and Robbins prepared for publication. For a long time it seemed like a safe bet.

Certainly Euclid’s Elements has demonstrated that an inspired mathematical text can serve a very long time. In recent years, however, even Euclid has increasingly been charged with irrelevance. “In an age when computing power is abundant these maths are obsolete. At a minimum, it is time to transfer responsibility for teaching geometry to the history department. The problems for which geometry entered the schools have been either solved or taken over by other methods.” So wrote the senior manager of a supercomputer company in a highly lauded glimpse of our digital future [2]. His is not an isolated voice. Though theorems once proved stay proved forever, appreciation of them can wane. What effect will shifts of interest have on Courant and Robbins? How will What Is Mathematics? hold up now that the good high school course that Courant spoke of is in danger of vanishing? How many students will be prepared to fight their way through Courant and Robbins in a time when education is so often confused with painless entertainment? I think that these questions are already being answered. For many reasons I find that Körner’s The Pleasures of Counting [7] makes a more accessible recommendation for the sort of student I would have directed to Courant and Robbins twenty years ago. That in itself is not a bad thing: though it bears little resemblance to Courant and Robbins, Körner’s book can fairly be described as “inspirational collateral reading.” It allows the beginner to peek into the mathematician’s art, and it is excellent. Do not take my word for it-see the Notices review [4]. That review urged the placement of The Pleasures of Counting in high school libraries where it can influence the talented student who might consider a career in mathematics. I would urge no less for Courant and Robbins. What Is Mathematics? should be in every high school library. You never know what life it might change when some curious student pulls it down from the shelf.

## Bản dịch tiếng Việt

Ba mươi hai năm trước, khi đang dạo quanh thư viện trường trung học của mình, tôi tình cờ bắt gặp một cuốn sách giới thiệu có tựa đề thật lôi cuốn. Vào thời điểm đó, tôi biết rất ít - đến mức đáng kinh ngạc - về việc “làm toán” thực sự là gì.

Tôi chỉ biết rằng hình học bắt nguồn từ Thales, Pythagoras và Euclid. Còn việc sau Euclid có ai phát hiện thêm định lý hình học nào nữa hay không, tôi hoàn toàn không biết. Tôi cũng không hề nghĩ rằng đại số hay lượng giác là kết quả của một quá trình phát triển có chủ đích - chẳng khác nào việc tin rằng tiếng Anh được “sáng tạo” bởi các nhà ngôn ngữ học chuyên nghiệp.

Tôi biết tên tuổi và công trình của nhiều nhà khoa học: Copernicus, Kepler và Galileo trong thiên văn; Darwin, Mendel và Pasteur trong sinh học; Boyle, Lavoisier và Curie trong hóa học; Archimedes, Newton và Einstein trong vật lý; Jenner, Harvey và Koch trong y học; và nhiều người khác nữa - nhưng chẳng ai trong số họ là nhà toán học. Dù khi đọc giải trí Hall và Knight tôi từng gặp vài họ tên lạ như Venn hay Horner, tôi chẳng biết một nhà khoa học hàng đầu nào thuộc lĩnh vực Toán học. Thật ra, tôi thậm chí chưa từng thực sự biết rằng tồn tại một “ngành” như thế.

Cuốn sách mà tôi lấy xuống khỏi giá hôm đó đã làm được nhiều hơn việc mở mang tầm mắt - nó đã thay đổi cả cuộc đời tôi. Tôi tốt nghiệp trung học vào cuối năm ấy, với phần thưởng là một phiếu mua sách trị giá hai mươi đô-la. Có lẽ đáng ra tôi nên khôn ngoan giữ nó lại để mua những giáo trình đại học sắp tới. Nhưng vì không còn được vào thư viện trường nữa, tôi có một nhu cầu cấp thiết hơn: với chưa đến chín đô-la, cuốn _What Is Mathematics?_ của Richard Courant và Herbert Robbins đã trở thành quyển đầu tiên trong tủ sách Toán học của tôi.

Chỉ cần tóm tắt sơ lược cũng đủ nói lên cấu trúc cuốn sách nổi tiếng này. Chương đầu tiên chủ yếu nói về lý thuyết số; tiếp đó là chương về số thực và số phức, bao gồm _Dedekind cuts_, lý thuyết lực lượng của Cantor và cách xây dựng số siêu việt của Liouville.

Chương ba bàn về mở rộng trường và các phép dựng hình học, đặc biệt phân tích sâu các bài toán bất khả thi trong dựng hình Hy Lạp cổ (dừng lại trước chứng minh Định lý Lindemann). Sau đó là các chương về hình học xạ ảnh và tô-pô học.

Để chuẩn bị cho phần sau, Courant và Robbins giới thiệu định nghĩa chặt chẽ của giới hạn, kèm theo các chứng minh thực sự của Định lý Giá trị Trung gian và Định lý Giá trị Cực trị. Hai chương cuối nói về tối ưu hóa và phép tính vi - tích phân, được sắp xếp theo một trật tự khác thường: phép tính biến phân trước, đạo hàm sau.

Như thường thấy ở những tác phẩm trình bày khéo léo các chủ đề sâu sắc, _What Is Mathematics?_ có thể được đọc ở nhiều tầng mức khác nhau. Một nhà toán học chuyên nghiệp chưa từng đọc cuốn sách này vẫn có thể tìm thấy điều mới trong các chương về hình học xạ ảnh và tối ưu hóa. Còn vô số chi tiết nhỏ lại đem đến niềm thích thú cho người đọc, như “chứng minh” rằng mọi số nguyên dương đều bằng nhau - để cảnh báo về việc dùng sai quy nạp toán học; hoặc một “chứng minh” khác của cùng điều phi lý ấy để chỉ ra tầm quan trọng của việc xác định sự tồn tại của cực trị trước khi tìm giá trị của nó.

Tất nhiên, _What Is Mathematics?_ không được viết cho giới chuyên môn. Nhiều chủ đề trong sáu chương đầu gợi nhớ đến những cuốn “sách chuyển tiếp” hiện nay dùng cho sinh viên năm hai, năm ba ngành Toán - những cuốn mang tên _Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning_ chẳng hạn. Thực tế, Courant và Robbins từng hình dung sách của họ có thể dùng trong “các khóa học đại học phi truyền thống về những khái niệm nền tảng của Toán học.”

Khi viết _What Is Mathematics?_, Courant mong cuốn sách đến được với một công chúng rộng hơn - những người có học thức nhưng không chuyên về Toán. Vì thế, ông nhấn mạnh rằng sách “chỉ giả định kiến thức mà một khóa học trung học tốt có thể mang lại.” Vào thời điểm đó (1941), phép tính vi phân thậm chí còn chưa xuất hiện trong chương trình trung học.

Trong sáu mươi năm kể từ khi _Courant and Robbins_ được xuất bản, nhiều học giả danh tiếng đã ca ngợi nó.
E. T. Bell gọi đây là “tác phẩm đọc thêm đầy cảm hứng”; Hermann Weyl xem là “một công trình hoàn hảo”; Marston Morse coi là “một tác phẩm nghệ thuật”; và cả Albert Einstein cũng khen ngợi.

Blank viết rằng, để không tỏ ra khiêm tốn giả tạo, ông phải thú nhận: khi đọc lần đầu, ông mang theo “một thứ mà các nhà bác học kia không có - sự ngu ngơ tuyệt đối.” Einstein thấy dễ hiểu, còn ông thì phải vật lộn.

Dù _What Is Mathematics?_ hầu như không yêu cầu kiến thức nền, “một mức độ trưởng thành trí tuệ nhất định” mà lời tựa nhắc đến lại là rào cản lớn với độc giả phổ thông. Chỉ sau 29 trang, cuốn sách đã nêu Định lý Số nguyên tố - khó mà tiêu hóa nổi nếu bạn chưa từng nghe đến logarit. Rồi tiếp theo là Định luật Tương hỗ bậc hai - đẹp đẽ nhưng cũng đầy thách thức.

Courant và Robbins có nhầm lẫn không? Hoàn toàn không. Như họ đã nói: “Không thể hiểu biết thật sự về Toán học qua giải trí nhẹ nhàng.”

Thế giới có thừa sách phổ thông lẩn tránh mọi khó khăn, nhưng _Courant and Robbins_ đã giành chỗ đứng vĩnh cửu nhờ không chỉ chứa đựng vô vàn sự kiện toán học mà còn cả tinh thần và phương pháp phía sau chúng. Theo Blank, sự cân bằng giữa trực giác và chặt chẽ trong sách là lý tưởng cho một tác phẩm phổ thông muốn phơi bày “bản chất thật của Toán học”. Mỗi chứng minh, dù khó đến đâu, đều chứa đựng một ý tưởng mà người kiên trì có thể lĩnh hội - và không có khởi đầu nào tốt hơn cho sự trưởng thành trí tuệ.

**_(Câu chuyện Courant - Robbins, mối quan hệ hợp tác và mâu thuẫn của họ)_**

Nếu thế giới diễn ra như ta mong muốn, *What Is Mathematics?* hẳn đã bán chạy như bia rẻ. Courant từng kỳ vọng rất cao về cuốn sách mà ông nói rằng “thể hiện quan điểm và khát vọng cá nhân của tôi hơn bất kỳ ấn phẩm nào khác.” Dù chính ông thừa nhận cái tên có phần “hơi lừa dối”, Courant nghe theo lời khuyên của Thomas Mann - người hiểu rõ sức hấp dẫn của một tựa đề gợi tò mò. Thế nhưng, bất chấp sự quyến rũ của cái tên, doanh số của *What Is Mathematics?* vẫn không đạt kỳ vọng. Theo ước tính của Constance Reid, đến năm 1976 chỉ khoảng hơn 100.000 bản được bán ra - nghĩa là lượng mua cá nhân mỗi năm chẳng đáng kể.

Điều khiến Courant thất vọng lại trở thành *nỗi cay đắng của Herbert Robbins*. Robbins, năm 1938, mới 23 tuổi, vừa bảo vệ luận án tiến sĩ về tô-pô học dưới sự hướng dẫn của Hassler Whitney. Một năm sau, ông đến Đại học New York làm giảng viên, đúng lúc Courant đang cần người giúp chỉnh sửa và mở rộng tập bản thảo đánh máy sơ sài sẽ trở thành *What Is Mathematics?*

Robbins vốn “chưa từng có chút hiểu biết hay hứng thú nào với xác suất hay thống kê,” nhưng bị phân công dạy những môn này khi William Feller không thể đến NYU như kế hoạch. Chính từ đó bắt đầu sự nghiệp rực rỡ của ông trong thống kê toán học. Sau chiến tranh thế giới thứ hai, Robbins giảng dạy tại Đại học Bắc Carolina, rồi từ 1953 đến khi nghỉ hưu năm 1985, ông gắn bó với Đại học Columbia. Khi nghỉ hưu lần hai ở Đại học Rutgers (1997), ông đã có một sự nghiệp lẫy lừng, và tên tuổi ông lại được nhắc đến rầm rộ khi *một chương trình máy tính tại Phòng thí nghiệm Argonne* chứng minh được “vấn đề Robbins” - bài toán do chính ông nêu ra năm 1933 - điều mà con người thất bại suốt hơn 60 năm.

Robbins là một nhà văn xuất sắc: văn phong khiêu khích, dí dỏm mà thanh nhã. Chính cơ duyên đưa ông đến NYU đã khiến Courant tìm thấy một cộng sự lý tưởng. Theo Robbins, khi ông tham gia, bản thảo mới chỉ hoàn thiện khoảng một phần tư. Sự hợp tác giữa họ rất mật thiết - “pretty close,” như Robbins nói.

Tuy nhiên, quy tắc ngầm của giới toán học là không hỏi “ai viết phần nào”, và mỗi đồng tác giả đều được “nhận ba phần tư công trạng.” Nhưng trong trường hợp này, *chênh lệch địa vị giữa Courant và Robbins quá lớn*. Cuốn sách chỉ đề tặng “các con của Courant”, lời tựa do Courant viết và ký tên một mình, bản quyền cũng đứng tên ông. Robbins mệt mỏi với những câu hỏi thiếu tế nhị về vai trò của mình (và từng có câu đáp trả chua cay nổi tiếng). Cuối cùng, mối quan hệ ấy tan vỡ trong oán giận.

Blank viết: thật mỉa mai thay - như Gian-Carlo Rota từng nói, các nhà toán học thường được nhớ đến nhờ *các công trình diễn giải*, chứ không phải nghiên cứu gốc. Courant và Robbins là minh chứng sống động nhất cho bài học đó. Tên họ đã gắn liền suốt sáu mươi năm và sẽ còn gắn mãi.

Ông ví họ như *cặp đôi Gilbert & Sullivan*: Gilbert từng viết nhiều vở kịch được yêu thích nhưng nay chỉ còn được nhớ trong giới học thuật; Sullivan sáng tác những bản nhạc hoành tráng nhưng cũng dần bị quên lãng. Tuy vậy, khi hợp tác, họ đã tạo nên những kiệt tác bất tử - dù quan hệ tan rã vì tranh chấp, tác phẩm của họ vẫn sống mãi. *Courant and Robbins* cũng vậy: những thành tựu riêng của mỗi người có thể phai nhạt, nhưng công trình chung của họ dường như được định sẵn để tỏa sáng mãi.

Ngay cả một tác phẩm kinh điển cũng cần được “làm mới” theo thời gian, đặc biệt khi muốn phản ánh diện mạo hiện tại của một lĩnh vực đang phát triển. *Courant and Robbins* đã quá lâu chưa được cập nhật, cho đến khi Nhà xuất bản Đại học Oxford phát hành *ấn bản thứ hai năm 1996*, được ghi là *“Courant and Robbins, revised by Ian Stewart.”*

Blank nhận xét: phần “revised by Ian Stewart” có phần đánh lừa độc giả. Mở cuốn sách ra, người đọc sẽ thấy mọi thứ như cũ: các hình minh họa, kiểu chữ, bố cục - thậm chí cả lỗi chính tả “Arch medes” ở trang 400. Cả bản gốc được in lại y nguyên, đến mức Blank nói đùa rằng *ông không tìm thấy nổi một thay đổi nhỏ nào*. Stewart biện minh trong lời tựa: *“Không cần xóa bỏ một từ hay ký hiệu nào.”*

Blank mỉa mai: “Thật sao? Sau nửa thế kỷ mà chẳng sửa nổi tên Archimedes? Và còn ai bây giờ vẫn nói *dyadic system* thay vì *binary system*?”

Dù vậy, Blank vẫn thừa nhận: việc giữ nguyên kiểu chữ cổ, thay vì chuyển sang định dạng *TeX* đồng nhất như thời nay, lại mang đến cảm giác hoài niệm dễ chịu.

Ấn bản mới chỉ thêm một chương cuối dài 37 trang, mang tên *“Recent Developments”* do Ian Stewart viết. Blank công nhận Stewart là một tác giả phổ biến Toán học kỳ cựu, nhưng ông không hoàn toàn hài lòng.

Theo Blank, lỗi lớn nhất là *Stewart giữ nguyên toàn bộ văn bản gốc*, kể cả các nội dung đã lỗi thời, mà không chú thích, không cập nhật, không hướng người đọc sang phần bổ sung. Do đó, độc giả hiện đại vẫn thấy *Định lý Cuối cùng của Fermat*, *Bài toán Bốn màu*, *Giả thuyết Liên tục* được trình bày y như năm 1947.

Blank cho rằng điều này gây hiểu lầm, nhất là với người đọc không chuyên - họ đâu biết rằng Fermat’s Last Theorem đã được chứng minh, hay Four Color Problem đã được giải quyết!

Ngoài ra, Blank còn phê bình cách Stewart mở rộng nội dung quá nhiều mà không tạo nền tảng cho người đọc: Courant và Robbins chỉ bàn đến hàm zeta $\zeta(s)$ khi $s\geq 1$, còn Stewart đi thẳng đến Giả thuyết Riemann và thậm chí cả phiên bản tổng quát của nó - một bước nhảy “quá xa.”

Stewart cũng đưa thêm khái niệm “chiều Hausdorff” và fractal - những chủ đề hấp dẫn nhưng không phù hợp với tinh thần nguyên bản của Courant & Robbins, vốn luôn chặt chẽ và có chọn lọc.

Blank kết luận: dù Stewart là cây bút xuất sắc, ấn bản 1996 vẫn chỉ là **“bản sao chụp được gắn thêm phần hậu truyện.”** Tuy nhiên, vì bản gốc được giữ nguyên trọn vẹn, ông xem chương bổ sung như một “món quà thêm” đáng quý.

***(Blank nhìn lại thời gian, Hardy, Euclid, và tự hỏi về tương lai của việc học Toán.)***

Khi tôi lật những trang giấy đã ngả vàng của ấn bản đầu tiên, thấy những dòng ghi chú bằng nét bút của chính mình - những dòng tôi đã quên hẳn - tôi chợt nghĩ về sức sống lâu bền của cuốn sách này, và điều đó khiến tôi suy ngẫm rất nhiều. Ngôi trường trung học nơi tôi lần đầu tìm thấy *What Is Mathematics?* đã bị niêm phong từ lâu. Hiệu sách nơi tôi mua nó nay đã biến thành quán cà phê latte. Và giờ đây, cả hai tác giả đều đã qua đời. *Thời gian trôi thật nhanh.*

Giới toán học chúng tôi thường tự hào rằng lĩnh vực của mình có tính vĩnh cửu - một đặc tính hiếm thấy ở nơi khác. Hardy từng viết:

> “Toán học Hy Lạp là vĩnh cửu, thậm chí còn bền lâu hơn văn chương Hy Lạp. Archimedes sẽ còn được nhớ đến khi Aeschylus đã bị quên lãng, bởi ngôn ngữ rồi sẽ chết, còn ý tưởng toán học thì không.”

Hardy viết những dòng ấy đúng vào thời điểm Courant và Robbins chuẩn bị cho việc xuất bản *What Is Mathematics?*
Suốt nhiều thập niên, điều đó dường như hiển nhiên đúng.

Thật vậy, *Elements* của Euclid là minh chứng hùng hồn rằng một văn bản Toán học được thắp sáng bởi cảm hứng có thể trường tồn qua hàng thiên niên kỷ.
Nhưng những năm gần đây, ngay cả Euclid cũng bắt đầu bị xem là “lỗi thời”. Một giám đốc điều hành của một công ty siêu máy tính từng viết, trong một bài tiểu luận ca ngợi “tương lai kỹ thuật số” của nhân loại:

> “Trong thời đại mà sức mạnh tính toán đã dư thừa, những phép toán này trở nên lỗi thời. Ít nhất, đã đến lúc giao việc dạy hình học cho khoa Lịch sử. Những bài toán từng khiến hình học bước vào trường học nay đều đã được giải quyết, hoặc được thay thế bằng những phương pháp khác.”

Đó không phải là một tiếng nói đơn độc. Dù các định lý, một khi đã được chứng minh, sẽ mãi đúng, nhưng **sự trân trọng dành cho chúng có thể tàn phai.**
Blank hỏi:

> Những thay đổi trong mối quan tâm ấy sẽ ảnh hưởng thế nào tới *Courant and Robbins*?
> Liệu *What Is Mathematics?* có còn đứng vững khi những “khóa học trung học tốt” mà Courant từng nói đến đang dần biến mất?
> Còn bao nhiêu học sinh sẽ đủ kiên nhẫn đọc hết cuốn sách ấy trong một thời đại mà giáo dục bị đánh đồng với giải trí không cần nỗ lực?

Ông tự trả lời: “Tôi nghĩ những câu hỏi này đang dần có lời giải.”

Vì nhiều lý do, Blank nhận ra rằng cuốn *The Pleasures of Counting* (Tom Körner, 1996) là lựa chọn thích hợp hơn cho kiểu sinh viên mà hai mươi năm trước ông sẽ giới thiệu đọc *What Is Mathematics?* Tuy vậy, ông không xem đó là điều buồn - bởi dù khác biệt, Körner vẫn kế thừa tinh thần “truyền cảm hứng” của Courant & Robbins.

> “Cuốn sách ấy cho phép người mới học hé nhìn vào nghệ thuật của nhà toán học - và nó tuyệt vời. Hãy xem bài điểm sách trên *Notices* [4], nơi người ta khuyến nghị đưa *The Pleasures of Counting* vào thư viện trung học để truyền cảm hứng cho những học sinh có năng khiếu Toán. Tôi cũng không đòi hỏi gì ít hơn cho Courant và Robbins.”

Blank kết lại bằng một hình ảnh vừa giản dị vừa sâu sắc:

> *“What Is Mathematics? nên có mặt trong mọi thư viện trung học. Ta chẳng bao giờ biết cuộc đời nào sẽ đổi thay khi một học sinh tò mò tình cờ rút nó xuống khỏi giá sách.”*

| Thirty-two years ago while browsing in my high school library, I happened upon an intriguingly titled expository book. I knew astonishingly little of the practice of mathematics at the time.                                                                                                                     | Ba mươi hai năm trước, khi đang dạo quanh thư viện trường trung học của mình, tôi tình cờ bắt gặp một cuốn sách giới thiệu có tựa đề thật lôi cuốn. Vào thời điểm đó, tôi biết rất ít - đến mức đáng kinh ngạc - về việc “làm toán” thực sự là gì.                                                                                               |
| I was aware that geometry derived from Thales, Pythagoras, and Euclid. Whether or not any geometric theorems were discovered after Euclid I could not say.                                                                                                                                                         | Tôi chỉ biết rằng hình học bắt nguồn từ Thales, Pythagoras và Euclid. Còn việc sau Euclid có ai phát hiện thêm định lý hình học nào nữa hay không, tôi hoàn toàn không biết.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| That algebra and trigonometry were the results of conscious development would no more have occurred to me than the idea that the English language was the creation of dedicated professional linguists.                                                                                                            | Tôi cũng không hề nghĩ rằng đại số hay lượng giác là kết quả của một quá trình phát triển có chủ đích - chẳng khác nào việc tin rằng tiếng Anh được “sáng tạo” bởi các nhà ngôn ngữ học chuyên nghiệp.                                                                                                                                           |
| I knew the names and work of many scientists-Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo in astronomy; Darwin, Mendel, and Pasteur in biology; Boyle, Lavoisier, and Curie in chemistry; Archimedes, Newton, and Einstein in physics; Jenner, Harvey, and Koch in medicine; and many others, none of whom were mathematicians. | Tôi biết tên tuổi và công trình của nhiều nhà khoa học: Copernicus, Kepler và Galileo trong thiên văn; Darwin, Mendel và Pasteur trong sinh học; Boyle, Lavoisier và Curie trong hóa học; Archimedes, Newton và Einstein trong vật lý; Jenner, Harvey và Koch trong y học; và nhiều người khác nữa - nhưng chẳng ai trong số họ là nhà toán học. |
| Although my recreational reading of Hall and Knight had exposed me to an odd assortment of surnames, such as Venn and Horner, I knew of no first-rate scientist in the field of mathematics. Indeed, I did not really know that there was such a field.                                                            | Dù khi đọc giải trí Hall và Knight tôi từng gặp vài họ tên lạ như Venn hay Horner, nhưng tôi chẳng biết một nhà khoa học hàng đầu nào thuộc lĩnh vực Toán học. Thật ra, tôi thậm chí chưa từng thực sự biết rằng tồn tại một “ngành” như thế.                                                                                                    |
| The book I pulled off the shelf that day did more than open my eyes; it changed my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Cuốn sách mà tôi lấy xuống khỏi giá hôm đó đã làm được nhiều hơn việc mở mang tầm mắt - nó đã thay đổi cả cuộc đời tôi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| I graduated from high school later that year, armed with a twenty-dollar book certificate. It might have been prudent to save my award for the college textbooks that I would soon require.                                                                                                                        | Tôi tốt nghiệp trung học vào cuối năm ấy, với phần thưởng là một phiếu mua sách trị giá hai mươi đô-la. Có lẽ đáng ra tôi nên khôn ngoan giữ nó lại để mua những giáo trình đại học sắp tới.                                                                                                                                                     |
| However, with no further access to my school library, I had a more pressing need. For less than nine dollars What Is Mathematics? by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins became the first volume in my collection of mathematics books.                                                                            | Nhưng vì không còn được vào thư viện trường nữa, tôi có một nhu cầu cấp thiết hơn: với chưa đến chín đô-la, cuốn _What Is Mathematics?_ của Richard Courant và Herbert Robbins đã trở thành quyển đầu tiên trong tủ sách Toán học của tôi.                                                                                                       |

| In preparation for the remainder of the book, Courant and Robbins continue with a chapter that introduces the reader to the rigorous definition of limit, reinforced by genuine proofs of the Intermediate and Extreme Value Theorems. | Để chuẩn bị cho phần còn lại của sách, Courant và Robbins tiếp tục bằng một chương giới thiệu định nghĩa chặt chẽ của giới hạn, kèm theo các chứng minh thật sự của Định lý Giá trị Trung gian và Định lý Giá trị Cực trị. |
| Optimization and calculus constitute the final two chapters in a rather unusual ordering: the calculus of variations is introduced before the calculus, the definite integral before the derivative.                                   | Hai chương cuối nói về tối ưu hóa và phép tính vi - tích phân, được sắp xếp theo một thứ tự khá lạ: _phép tính biến phân_ được giới thiệu trước phép tính vi phân, _tích phân xác định_ xuất hiện trước đạo hàm.           |

| As is often the case with skilled exposition of deep subject matter, _What Is Mathematics?_ can be read at different levels.                                             | Như thường thấy ở những tác phẩm trình bày khéo léo các chủ đề sâu sắc, _What Is Mathematics?_ có thể được đọc ở nhiều tầng mức khác nhau.                                       |
| The professional mathematician who has not yet encountered the book is likely to find new things in the chapters on projective geometry and optimization.                | Một nhà toán học chuyên nghiệp chưa từng đọc cuốn sách này có thể sẽ tìm thấy điều mới mẻ trong các chương về hình học xạ ảnh và tối ưu hóa.                                     |
| Also rewarding are the numerous small details that illuminate material that is more old hat.                                                                             | Bên cạnh đó, còn có vô số chi tiết nhỏ nhưng thú vị, giúp soi sáng những nội dung vốn quen thuộc.                                                                                |
| For example, an excellent “proof” that all positive integers are equal warns the reader against improper use of mathematical induction.                                  | Chẳng hạn, một “chứng minh tuyệt hảo” rằng _mọi số nguyên dương đều bằng nhau_ nhằm cảnh báo người đọc về việc sử dụng sai nguyên lý quy nạp toán học.                           |
| Later on, a quite different “proof” of the same absurdity illustrates the need for establishing the existence of an extremum before it is determined.                    | Về sau, một “chứng minh” khác của cùng điều phi lý đó cho thấy tầm quan trọng của việc phải xác định sự tồn tại của cực trị trước khi tính toán cụ thể nó.                       |
| Of course, _What Is Mathematics?_ was not written for the professional mathematician.                                                                                    | Tất nhiên, _What Is Mathematics?_ không được viết dành cho giới toán học chuyên nghiệp.                                                                                          |
| Many of the topics that are covered in the first six chapters bring to mind the “transition” books that have sprouted up in the last decade.                             | Nhiều chủ đề trong sáu chương đầu gợi nhớ đến những cuốn “sách chuyển tiếp” đã nở rộ trong thập niên gần đây.                                                                    |
| They are often intended for sophomore or junior mathematics majors and have titles such as _Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning_.                                     | Những cuốn sách ấy thường nhắm tới sinh viên năm hai, năm ba ngành Toán và mang các tựa như _Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning_ (Nhập môn Tư duy Toán học).                 |
| In fact, Courant and Robbins foresaw that their book could serve as the text for “college courses of an unconventional type on the fundamental concepts of mathematics.” | Thực ra, Courant và Robbins đã dự liệu rằng cuốn sách của họ có thể dùng làm giáo trình cho “những khóa học đại học kiểu phi truyền thống về các khái niệm cơ bản của Toán học”. |
| In conceiving _What Is Mathematics?_, Courant hoped for a wide readership that would comprise a broad spectrum of educated laypersons.                                   | Khi hình thành _What Is Mathematics?_, Courant hy vọng có thể tiếp cận một lượng độc giả rộng, bao gồm cả những người có học thức nhưng không chuyên về Toán.                    |
| Accordingly, _What Is Mathematics?_ “presupposes only knowledge that a good high school course could impart.”                                                            | Vì thế, _What Is Mathematics?_ “chỉ giả định kiến thức mà một khóa học trung học tốt có thể mang lại.”                                                                           |
| In those days-the first edition appeared in 1941, followed by three revisions at two-year intervals-calculus was rarely if ever part of the high school curriculum.      | Vào thời đó - ấn bản đầu tiên ra mắt năm 1941, sau đó được chỉnh lý ba lần, cách nhau hai năm - phép tính vi phân gần như chưa bao giờ xuất hiện trong chương trình trung học.   |

| In the sixty years during which Courant and Robbins, as the book is often called, has been in print, several distinguished scholars have had the opportunity to sing its praises.                                                                             | Trong sáu mươi năm kể từ khi _Courant and Robbins_ - cách gọi quen thuộc của cuốn sách - được xuất bản, nhiều học giả danh tiếng đã có dịp cất lời ca ngợi nó.                                                                                  |
| Reviewing the first edition, E. T. Bell described the work as “inspirational collateral reading.”                                                                                                                                                             | Khi bình luận về ấn bản đầu tiên, E. T. Bell gọi tác phẩm này là “một tài liệu đọc thêm đầy cảm hứng.”                                                                                                                                          |

| For Marston Morse it was simply “a work of art.”                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Với Marston Morse, đó đơn giản là “một tác phẩm nghệ thuật.”                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Even Albert Einstein chimed in with high praise.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Ngay cả Albert Einstein cũng góp lời khen ngợi nồng nhiệt.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Any subsequent reviewer with the slightest humility would be excused for feeling that his further say-so would only be superfluous.                                                                                                                           | Bất kỳ người viết phê bình nào về sau, nếu còn giữ chút khiêm tốn, đều có thể cảm thấy rằng mọi lời khen thêm nữa chỉ là thừa thãi.                                                                                                             |
| To counter the perception of immodesty, I should point out that I brought something to my first reading of Courant and Robbins that none of these learned scientists could boast: profound ignorance.                                                         | Để tránh bị xem là khiêm tốn giả tạo, tôi phải nói rõ rằng khi đọc _Courant and Robbins_ lần đầu, tôi mang theo thứ mà không một nhà khoa học uyên bác nào kể trên có được: sự ngu ngơ tuyệt đối.                                               |
| Whereas Einstein found the text “easily understandable,” I often struggled.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Nếu Einstein thấy cuốn sách “dễ hiểu”, thì tôi đã phải vật lộn với nó không ít.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Though the prerequisites for _What Is Mathematics?_ are minimal, the “certain degree of intellectual maturity” that is mentioned vaguely in the preface is likely to be a steep hurdle for the hypothetical layperson Courant hoped to capture as his reader. | Dù _What Is Mathematics?_ hầu như không đòi hỏi kiến thức nền, thì “một mức độ trưởng thành trí tuệ nhất định” - điều mà lời tựa đề cập một cách mơ hồ - lại có thể là rào cản lớn đối với kiểu độc giả phổ thông mà Courant mong muốn thu hút. |

| There are plenty of popular books that run away from every mathematical difficulty; the reader who seeks such a treatment has always been well served.                                                      | Có vô số sách phổ thông né tránh mọi khó khăn Toán học - và độc giả muốn đọc kiểu đó xưa nay vẫn được phục vụ đầy đủ.                                                                |
| _Courant and Robbins_ has earned what ought to be a permanent place in the mathematical literature by conveying not only a treasure-trove of mathematical facts but also the ideas and methods behind them. | _Courant and Robbins_ xứng đáng có vị trí vĩnh viễn trong kho tàng Toán học, vì nó không chỉ truyền đạt kho dữ kiện phong phú mà còn cả những ý tưởng và phương pháp đứng sau chúng. |
| To my mind the balance of intuition and rigor is just right for a popular book that intends to lay open the real substance of mathematics.                                                                  | Theo tôi, sự cân bằng giữa trực giác và chặt chẽ trong sách này là hoàn hảo đối với một tác phẩm phổ thông muốn phơi bày bản chất thật của Toán học.                                 |

Gilbert đã viết nhiều vở kịch được tán thưởng, nhưng nay chỉ còn được biết đến trong giới chuyên nghiên cứu sân khấu thời Victoria. |
| Sullivan composed many popular vocal and orchestral works: they are rarely heard nowadays.

| Even a classic can benefit from a sprucing up now and then, especially if it seeks to portray the existing state of an active field.                                                                           | Ngay cả một tác phẩm kinh điển cũng có thể hưởng lợi từ việc “tút lại” đôi chút, nhất là khi nó mô tả tình trạng hiện thời của một lĩnh vực đang phát triển mạnh.                                   |
| _Courant and Robbins_ was long overdue for an update when Oxford University Press brought out a second edition in 1996.                                                                                        | _Courant and Robbins_ đã quá hạn cần được cập nhật khi Nhà xuất bản Oxford phát hành ấn bản thứ hai vào năm 1996.                                                                                   |

| All the old figures are there. Even the original typesetting has been preserved-quite a welcome change from the homogenized TeX of the present.                                                                | Tất cả các hình vẽ cũ vẫn còn đó.

| Closer inspection, however, reveals something less welcome: the new edition is by and large a photographic reproduction.                                                                                       | Tuy nhiên, xem kỹ hơn sẽ thấy điều ít vui: ấn bản mới phần lớn chỉ là bản sao chụp lại.                                                                                                             |
| I could not find even one change in it.

| Yet, without further preparation, Stewart rattles off its statement and, not stopping there, tells us what we will know should the (unstated) Generalized Riemann Hypothesis ever be proved true.

| Although Stewart asserts in his preface that he has “made no attempt to introduce new topics that have recently come to prominence,” he admits to bending his rules on occasion.                                                                                                | Dù Stewart khẳng định trong lời tựa rằng ông “không cố đưa vào các chủ đề mới nổi gần đây,” ông cũng thừa nhận đôi khi “nới tay” với nguyên tắc đó.                                                                                         |
| Thus, the treatment of dimension by Courant and Robbins, fitting for its place in the chapter on topology, is used by Stewart as a pretext for a digression on Hausdorff dimension.                                                                                             | Chẳng hạn, phần bàn về khái niệm “chiều” của Courant và Robbins (vốn rất hợp lý trong chương về tô-pô) lại được Stewart dùng làm cái cớ để lan man sang “chiều Hausdorff.”                                                                  |

| This is a matter of the camel’s nose slipping under the tent: once Hausdorff dimension enters, fractals inevitably follow.                                                                                                                                                      | Đây đúng là “mũi lạc đà chui vào lều”: khi đã có chiều Hausdorff, thì fractal tất yếu sẽ kéo theo.                                                                                                                                          |
| Granted, fractals can be amusing and even the source of serious mathematics. However, when given a gratuitous, superficial treatment, are they Courant-Robbins-worthy?                                                                                                          | Dĩ nhiên fractal có thể thú vị và thậm chí tạo ra Toán học nghiêm túc.

| Ironically, that challenge itself relies on the assumption that the train can move in a way that is physically impossible, as Gillman has pointed out in his review [5].                                                                                                        | Trớ trêu thay, chính thách thức đó lại dựa vào giả định rằng toa tàu có thể di chuyển theo một cách phi vật lý - như Gillman đã chỉ ra trong bài phê bình của ông [5].                                                                      |

Do not take my word for it-see the _Notices_ review [4].                                                                                                                                              | Nó cho phép người mới học hé nhìn vào “nghệ thuật của nhà toán học”, và quả thực rất tuyệt vời.

| That review urged the placement of _The Pleasures of Counting_ in high school libraries where it can influence the talented student who might consider a career in mathematics.                                                                                                         | Bài phê bình đó khuyến nghị đưa _The Pleasures of Counting_ vào các thư viện trung học, nơi nó có thể truyền cảm hứng cho những học sinh có năng khiếu đang nghĩ đến con đường toán học.                                                                                        |
| I would urge no less for Courant and Robbins. _What Is Mathematics?_ should be in every high school library. You never know what life it might change when some curious student pulls it down from the shelf.                                                                           | Tôi cũng sẽ không đòi hỏi gì ít hơn cho Courant và Robbins. _What Is Mathematics?_ nên có mặt trong mọi thư viện trung học. Ta chẳng bao giờ biết được cuộc đời nào sẽ đổi thay khi một học sinh tò mò tình cờ rút nó xuống khỏi giá sách.                                      |
